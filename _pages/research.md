My research lies at the intersection of applied electromagnetics, integrated circuits and signal processing, with a focus on millimeter-wave imaging and measurement systems. I also like to explore other areas every now and then. A list of my peer-reviewed publications are available at [this link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TtDtCaoAAAAJ&hl=enLinks). My [PhD defense](https://youtu.be/NXCXfW0bHyM) is a good summary of my past research.
