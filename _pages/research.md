My research lies at the intersection of applied electromagnetics, integrated circuits and signal processing, with a focus on millimeter-wave imaging. I also like to explore other areas every now and then. A list of my peer-reviewed publications are available at [this link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TtDtCaoAAAAJ&hl=enLinks). A broad overview of different projects I have worked on is given below. Useful links to design files are also included. 

# Antennas

## Ultra-Wideband Quad-Mode SIW Cavity-Backed Slot Antenna

The HFSS design and simulation file is available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x7v6aiFFheCkK9Ou6Q4aF9X4KvR3HXGO/view?usp=sharing). The paper describing the antenna is under review. Stay tuned!

# Imaging

## FMCW Circular SAR Time-Domain Wavefront Reconstruction

The codes are available at [this link](https://github.com/AdityaMuppala/FMCW-ICSAR-TDWR/tree/main). The paper describing the algorithm is under review. Stay tuned!
