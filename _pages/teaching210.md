# Course Objectives
To develop a strong foundation in electromagnetic theory for applications in antenna design, RF/microwave circuits, waveguides and resonators, computational electromagnetics, wave propagation, optics, and scattering. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the theory and applying it in a wide range of CAD experiments using ANSYS HFSS.

# Lecture Recordings and Notes
I will record lectures separately and post them to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@adityavarmamuppala). I prefer this since web capture on a whiteboard does not do a good job. Also, I will post the lecture notes on my website and to bCourses as the course progresses.

# Homework and Exams
One homework per week will be assigned on Friday and due the following Friday at midnight (11:59 PM). 

The first part of every homework will be to upload your notes from that week's lectures. This is to encourage you to take notes, which has been shown to improve learning and long-term retention, especially in mathematics. It is also an easy way to get points in the homework. You need not take notes in class during lecture. You can take them any time from the uploaded lecture notes or the lecture recordings. They can be handwritten or typed. If you do not want to take notes, that is fine, see grading policy below.

Additionally, there will be two to three problems and/or one CAD assignment in HFSS per week. I encourage collaboration, but every student must turn in individual homework and CAD solutions. I don't oppose the use of AI tools in solving homework problems. If you did use AI to solve part of a problem, say to solve an integral, be sure to cite it in your solution. There is no penalty for using AI, but remember that deep understanding comes from the confusion and frustration you go through when wrapping your head around a new problem or concept. If you don't put yourself through this, you will have learned nothing more than how to be a good prompt engineer, which is not the goal of this course.

We will have one mid-term and one final. Exam problems will be equivalent in difficulty to the homeworks. The main goal of exams is to force you to review the class material and test your conceptual understanding of the subject. They are not representative of research in real life so I don't take them too seriously and neither should you. As long as you do all the homeworks and have reviewed the material in class well, you will do well on the exams.

**Lastly, I highly recommend you attend office hours because this is where the magic happens in this class as we get to discuss problems on the homework, CAD and other cool stuff.**

# Grading
Your lowest homework grade will be dropped.

Score 1 = 20% Notes + 40% HW (including CAD) + 20% Mid-term + 20% Final.
Score 2 = 40% HW (including CAD) + 30% Mid-term + 30% Final.

Final grade = max{Score 1, Score 2}
