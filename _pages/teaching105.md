# Course Objectives
To develop a strong foundation in microelectronics from the device to the circuit level. We start from semiconductor physics and study the operation of PN-junction diodes, Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitors, Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), and MOS Field-Effect-Transistors (MOSFETs). From device technology we delve into circuit concepts. Single stage and multi-stage amplifiers are discussed in detail, including phasor analysis and frequency response. The course concludes with a brief discussion on differential amplifiers and operational amplifiers (OpAmps). The lectures will focus on developing a strong intuition for analog circuit design.

# Homework and Exams
One homework per week will be assigned on Tuesday and due the following Tuesday at midnight (11:59 PM). **Homework Party** is on Tue, 5:00 – 7:00 PM at TBD. You can come to the homework party to collaborate and work with others, with help from the GSI Haifa during the first hour.

The first part of every homework will be to upload your notes from that week's lectures. This is to encourage you to take notes, which has been shown to improve learning and long-term retention. It is also an easy way to get points in the homework. You need not take notes in class during lecture. You can take them any time from the uploaded lecture notes or the lecture recordings. They can be handwritten or typed. If you do not want to take notes, that is fine, see grading policy below.

I encourage collaboration, but every student must turn in individual homework solutions. I don't oppose the use of AI tools in solving homework problems. If you did use AI to solve part of a problem, be sure to cite it in your solution. There is no penalty for using AI, but remember that deep understanding comes from the confusion and frustration you go through when wrapping your head around a new problem or concept. If you don't put yourself through this, you will have learned nothing more than how to be a good prompt engineer, which is not the goal of this course.

We will have one mid-term and one final. Exam problems will be equivalent in difficulty to the homeworks.

Please carefully read the [Academic Misconduct Policy](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/academic-misconduct/). EE 105 is an upper division undergrad course, you are here because you choose to be! **Cheating will result in automatic Fail.**

# Grading
Your lowest homework grade will be dropped.

Score 1 = 10% Notes + 20% HW + 20% Lab + 20% Mid-term + 30% Final.

Score 2 = 20% HW + 20% Lab + 25% Mid-term + 35% Final.

Final grade = max{Score 1, Score 2}

# Late Submissions
The pre-lab worksheets, lab worksheets and homeworks are due at 11:59 PM on Tuesdays. For extensions on the homework you should send an email to the GSI Haifa (hsambo@berkeley.edu) and cc the instructor Aditya (muppala@berkeley.edu). For extensions on the pre-lab and lab worksheets you should send an email to the head lab TA Evan (evan_kuo@berkeley.edu) and cc the instructor Aditya (muppala@berkeley.edu). The emails must be **received by 6 PM on Tuesdays**. Emails received after this time will not be accomodated. Typically an extension of 2 days will be given. Note that the lowest HW grade will be dropped.
