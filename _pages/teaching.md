This page contains information about my teaching. Currently, I am mostly teaching through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@adityavarmamuppala437). In the past I have been a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) at the University of Michigan for an undergraduate level Circuits Analysis Design class (EECS 215) and a graduate level Microwave Measurements class (EECS 533). My current goal with the YouTube channel is to make advanced topics in Applied Electromagnetics and Integrated Circuits more accessible to researchers who may not have easy access to this information otherwise.

## Radar Imaging ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CRFXfRZxZ8&list=PL9Trid0A4Da1BWEiZc-_coDZmFxgSagKL&pp=iAQB))

The focus of this series is to cover the theory of image reconstruction algorithms while also providing simulation tools, code and in some cases experimental data. Radar Imaging in general is a very inter-disciplinary field and the hope is to get people from different areas interested in radar signal processing and imaging.

## Antennas and Arrays ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVfZkiY_1NM&list=PL9Trid0A4Da0TmzV_vpToGlJOALid2dKj&pp=iAQB))

I noticed that not a lot of videos exist on design and simulation of more advanced antennas and arrays and that was the reason I decided to start this series. I will cover topics that I feel are important for the next generation of antennas and phased arrays. The focus will be on practical design tutorials that anyone can follow regardless of their expertise in antennas.

## Millimeter-Wave Integrated Circuits ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9LaoKDRmzA&list=PL9Trid0A4Da1lh5hRCjpYMCDADtVXA9qU&pp=iAQB))

This is probably the series I am most excited about. The end goal here is to show someone from a non-IC background how to start from scratch and design a chip that can be taped-out. I use the Cadence Generic PDK to design circuits and also do some layouts. I try to cover some theory along with the designs.
